1- A SimCLR model needs to present. Adjust the paths to the model and dataset in SimCLR_args.py. Then run datagen.py to generate the clusters. The top k as well as the number of clusters can either be defined or set automatically based on the silhouette score of different candidates for the number of clusters in datagen.py.  

2- adjust the settings in the args.py folder then run main.py.
